This repo contains the implementation and demonstration of a deep learning-based authorship identification model. In particular, given a passage written by one out of a predefined list of authors on which the model has been trained, the model predicts which author wrote that passage.

- The [model's Python code](authorship-project.ipynb) is structured as a Jupyter Notebook.
- [The slides](slides.pdf) for a talk given about the model and [the accompanying report](report.pdf) are included.
